# Gokstad Akademiet Backend Programming – Python Learning Path

This repository documents my weekly Python exercises as part of the **two-year Backend Programming program at Gokstad Akademiet**. The full curriculum covers topics such as object-oriented programming, databases, REST APIs, and web technologies, but this repo focuses exclusively on the Python fundamentals portion of the program and intentionally omits any SQL work.

## Python Learning Goals
- Basic syntax, variables, and data types
- Control flow with conditions and loops
- Functions, modules, and standard libraries
- File I/O and error handling
- Introductory object-oriented programming concepts
- Simple web programming with Flask later in the course

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or later
- Recommended tools: a code editor (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm) and Git

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and change into the directory
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd python-learning-path
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install any required packages (none at the moment)
4. Run an exercise file with `python <file>`

## Folder Structure
- `oppgaver_uke34.py` – exercises for week 34
- `oppgavene/` – supplementary materials

## Contributing
Participants are welcome to extend the exercises or submit improvements:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Commit and push your changes
4. Open a pull request for review

## Future Improvements
- Add automated tests to validate exercise solutions
- Organize exercises into separate folders per week
- Introduce code style tools such as `black` or `flake8`
- Provide example solutions and additional documentation
